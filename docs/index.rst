preselector.uni-jena.de
=======================

preselector.uni-jena.de is a free online tool for preselection digests during molecular cloning. Digests of donor vectors using restriction enzymes can be incomplete, which can lead to religation of the donor backbone. In consequence, the transformation can be contaminated a high backgroud level of false positives. Preselection digests can reduce or even eliminate this background (illustrated below). 

preselector.uni-jena.de helps to identify appropriate restriction enzymes for preselection digests by matching provided DNA sequences with a restriction enzyme recognition sites and comparing availability of those sites in between the provided DNA sequences. The application is implemented in JavaScript and runs locally in the browser of the user, guaranteeing confidentiallity of DNA sequences.
